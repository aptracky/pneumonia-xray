# Detection of Pneumonia withing chest X-Rays using a CNN

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create a more efficient and accurate way to detect pneumonia in a patient's chest x-rays. This would allow for medical personnel to focus on more pressing matters. 

This project is inspired by the data set found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) on Kaggel.

The project can be found here in the notebook on github or you can run it on Kaggel [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/andrewpcodes/peterson-final-project).
